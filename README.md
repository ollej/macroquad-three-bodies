# Three bodies simulation in Macroquad

Implementation of the three body problem using the Macroquad game engine.

[Online demo](https://ollej.github.io/macroquad-three-bodies/) - It
precalculates the simulation, so it will take a while before the animation
starts.

Based on the [timClicks version](https://github.com/timClicks/tutorials/tree/main/202404-three-bodies).
